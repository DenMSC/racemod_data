Made initial entry with all current changes up until this point

Made a seperate hud (ale_racemod) for the Racemod servers, which utilize racesow's more accurate strafe bars and adds a coloring effect to strafe bars depending on strafe quality
Added cg_showPressedKeys 2 for constant printing of keystate (not just while chasing)
